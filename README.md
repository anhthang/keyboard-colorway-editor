Keyboard information, layouts, styles are based on the data from the [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/) with some of my modifications.

## ü•≥ Why I'm here
This project popped up in my mind when I ordered Canoe Gen 2 and wanted to see what it looks like when combined with the keysets I have. So if you have the same concern, here it is for you. Hope this helps people who are in the mechanical keyboard community in order to build a favorite keyboard.

## üéâ Feature
- [x] **3D keycap viewer** (except KAT profile)
- [x] Different font, text display per keycap profile
- [x] Support displaying characters of other languages
    - Hiragana (GMK Bento, Mecha-01, Sumi...)
    - Hangul (GMK Hanguk)
    - Cyrillics (GMK Yuri)
- [x] Multiple colorway selections for alphas, modifiers
- [x] Use SVG icons for novelties like Esc, Enter (SA Oblivion)

## üé® TODO

## üì¨ Pull Request
You are welcome.

- Add new keyboards:
    - Add new items at `public/keyboards.json`
    - Add new keyboard info at the `public/keyboards` folder following the data from QMK
    - Key `code` is required for layout, don't need any label here. Or you can use default layout (see `keyboards/percent/canoe`)

- Add new default layouts:
    - Add new files into public/layouts

- Add a new colorway:
    - Clone a new colorway from QMK or look at `src/scss/colorways.scss` and other files in the same folder
